#This does something...

1. Design and implement a service with JSON REST API that for a numerical input X, returns a list of all prime numbers that are less or equal to X.
For a bonus point, allow the caller to provide optionally the algorithm A to be used when calculating primes - use at least 2 algorithms.

Example:

Input: 5
Result: 2, 3, 5

Input: 50
Optional input: algorithm_name
Result: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.

2. Design and implement a service with JSON REST API that for any given String input Q, returns the second search result from Google for query Q, excluding ads."
